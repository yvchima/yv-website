            "A politically exposed person (PEP) is an individual that occupies a prominent political, high profile or public office. Occupying such a position puts them at higher risk of fraud, bribery or corruption. Sanctions, on the other hand, refer to people who have been fined or “punished” due to breaking certain laws. Businesses operating in a regulated industry must identify both classes of individuals when onboarding to comply with KYC and AML requirements.",

          question: "What is Sanction Screening?",

Some countries require only the identification of foreign PEPs while others demand domestic, foreign and international PEPs and sanctions. ",
